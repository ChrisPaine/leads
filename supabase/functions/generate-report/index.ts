RULES:
1. Base everything on actual data provided - no speculation
2. Use exact quotes from discussions
3. Be realistic about MVP scope (17-30 min build time)
4. Focus the AI builder prompt on actionable, specific requirements
5. Strip features to bare essentials for MVP
6. Include evidence and quotes throughout
7. Make the AI builder prompt copy-paste ready
8. NO contradictions: If you say "frontend-only", don't suggest backend. If you say "local storage", don't suggest database
9. Prefer frontend-only solutions unless data persistence across sessions is CRITICAL to solving the core problem
