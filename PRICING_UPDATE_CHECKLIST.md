## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Tasks (YOU MUST DO THESE)

### 1. Update Stripe Price IDs

**Location:** `src/components/pricing/PricingPage.tsx` (lines 18-23)

**Current IDs (placeholders):**
```typescript
const PRICE_IDS = {
  starter: 'price_1SDS1pGbEY7eE6CcwMAsIKOH',      // UPDATE to $14.99/mo
  professional: 'price_1SDS49GbEY7eE6Ccl7s1I9s7', // UPDATE to $29.99/mo
  agency: 'price_1SDS4KGbEY7eE6Cc4tJxYbcj',      // UPDATE to $49.99/mo
  creditPack: 'price_1SDS5MGbEY7eE6Cc6Dgd3ovB'   // Keep at $4.99
}
```

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/products
2. Create new products/prices for each tier
3. Copy the new Price IDs (start with `price_`)
4. Replace the IDs in the code above
5. Save the file

üìã **Full instructions:** See `STRIPE_PRICING_UPDATE.md`

### 2. Test the Pricing Page

**Before deploying, test these:**

  - [ ] Professional: $29.99/month (with "Most Popular" badge)
  - [ ] Agency: $49.99/month
  - [ ] One-Time: $4.99 one-time
- [ ] Verify all features are listed correctly (no CSV export, no API)
- [ ] Click each "Choose [Plan]" button
- [ ] Verify Stripe checkout opens with correct price
- [ ] Click "Get 10 Searches" button
- [ ] Verify one-time payment checkout opens
- [ ] Test on mobile device or resize browser
- [ ] Test in both light and dark modes
- [ ] Verify "Back to Research Tool" button works

### 3. Deploy to Production

After testing:

## üêõ Known Issues to Watch For

1. **Stripe Price IDs**: If checkout shows wrong price, check IDs

3. **Mobile Safari**: Test gradient text rendering
4. **Dark Mode**: Verify all colors are readable

## üìä Pricing Comparison

| Feature | Starter | Professional | Agency |
|---------|---------|--------------|--------|

## üí° Recommendations

1. **A/B Test Pricing**: Consider testing these prices vs. old pricing
2. **Annual Plans**: Consider adding annual billing (save 20%)
3. **Free Trial**: Consider 7-day free trial for Professional plan
4. **Usage Analytics**: Track which plan users choose most
5. **Conversion Optimization**: Monitor checkout abandonment rate
